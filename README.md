# ImageToASCII
Turns any Image in a ASCII image requires minor coding knowledge


Install cv2 with - pip install opencv-python

Install pillow with - pip install pillow

The color one and gray scale both require an image and output location which you have to select in the script there is also downscaling for large 
images(called descalle).

Have fun!
